# CareConnect Canada - Database Schema and Application Architecture

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the comprehensive database schema and application architecture for CareConnect Canada, a multilingual daycare management platform designed specifically for the Canadian market. The system supports three distinct user roles: Website Hosters (platform administrators), Daycare Providers, and Parents, each with specific access controls and functionality requirements.

The architecture follows a modern web application pattern with a Flask-based REST API backend and a React frontend, designed to handle complex relationships between users, children, incidents, payments, and administrative functions while maintaining strict data privacy and access controls.

## Database Schema Design

### Core User Management

The foundation of our system rests on a robust user management structure that accommodates three distinct user types while maintaining security and data isolation. The user authentication system implements role-based access control (RBAC) to ensure that each user type can only access appropriate data and functionality.

**Users Table**
The central users table serves as the authentication hub for all system users. Each user record contains essential authentication information including encrypted passwords, email verification status, and account creation timestamps. The user_type field determines the specific role and associated permissions, while the is_active flag allows for account suspension without data deletion.

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    password_hash VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    user_type ENUM('hoster', 'daycare', 'parent') NOT NULL,
    is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE,
    email_verified BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    last_login TIMESTAMP,
    preferred_language ENUM('en', 'fr') DEFAULT 'en'
);
```

**Website Hosters Table**
Website hosters represent the platform administrators who manage daycare accounts and subscriptions but cannot access sensitive daycare or child data. This separation ensures privacy compliance while enabling platform management.

```sql
CREATE TABLE website_hosters (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INTEGER UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    first_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    last_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    phone VARCHAR(20),
    admin_level ENUM('super_admin', 'admin', 'support') DEFAULT 'admin',
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);
```

### Daycare Management Structure

The daycare management structure forms the core operational component of the system, handling everything from basic daycare information to complex subscription management and feature access controls.

**Daycares Table**
Each daycare represents an independent childcare facility with its own staff, children, and operational data. The subscription model allows for flexible feature access based on the daycare's chosen plan, while the settings JSON field provides customizable operational parameters.

```sql
CREATE TABLE daycares (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    license_number VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE,
    address TEXT NOT NULL,
    city VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    province VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    postal_code VARCHAR(10) NOT NULL,
    phone VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    capacity INTEGER NOT NULL,
    age_groups JSON, -- ["infant", "toddler", "preschool", "school_age"]
    subscription_plan ENUM('basic', 'standard', 'premium') DEFAULT 'basic',
    subscription_status ENUM('active', 'suspended', 'cancelled') DEFAULT 'active',
    subscription_start_date DATE,
    subscription_end_date DATE,
    features_enabled JSON, -- {"incident_management": true, "payment_processing": true, ...}
    settings JSON, -- Custom daycare settings
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

**Daycare Staff Table**
The daycare staff table manages all employees associated with a daycare facility, including their roles and permissions within the daycare's operational scope. This allows for hierarchical management within each daycare while maintaining data isolation between different facilities.

```sql
CREATE TABLE daycare_staff (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    daycare_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    role ENUM('owner', 'director', 'teacher', 'assistant', 'admin') NOT NULL,
    hire_date DATE NOT NULL,
    is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE,
    permissions JSON, -- Specific permissions within the daycare
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    FOREIGN KEY (daycare_id) REFERENCES daycares(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    UNIQUE KEY unique_user_daycare (user_id, daycare_id)
);
```

### Parent and Child Management

## Application Architecture

### System Overview

CareConnect Canada follows a modern three-tier architecture pattern designed for scalability, maintainability, and security. The system separates concerns between data persistence, business logic, and user interface layers, enabling independent scaling and technology evolution.

The presentation layer consists of a React-based single-page application (SPA) that provides responsive, multilingual user interfaces optimized for both desktop and mobile devices. The application layer implements a RESTful API using Flask, handling authentication, authorization, business logic, and data validation. The data layer utilizes PostgreSQL for relational data storage with Redis for session management and caching.

### Authentication and Authorization Architecture

The authentication system implements JSON Web Token (JWT) based authentication with role-based access control (RBAC). Upon successful login, users receive a JWT containing their user ID, role, and associated permissions. The token is stored securely in the client application and included in all API requests for authorization.

Role-based permissions are enforced at multiple levels: route-level middleware validates user roles before allowing access to specific endpoints, method-level decorators check specific permissions for individual operations, and data-level filters ensure users can only access data they are authorized to view or modify.

The system implements the principle of least privilege, where users receive only the minimum permissions necessary for their role. Website hosters can manage daycare accounts and subscriptions but cannot access child or incident data. Daycare staff can access all data within their facility but cannot view information from other daycares. Parents can only access information related to their own children.

### Data Privacy and Security

Data privacy is paramount in the CareConnect Canada architecture, with multiple layers of protection ensuring compliance with Canadian privacy legislation including PIPEDA (Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act). All sensitive data is encrypted at rest using AES-256 encryption, while data in transit is protected using TLS 1.3.

The system implements strict data isolation between daycares, ensuring that no daycare can access another facility's data even in the event of a security breach. Database queries include mandatory filtering based on user permissions, and all data access is logged for audit purposes.

Personal information is minimized and anonymized wherever possible. Child photos and sensitive medical information are stored with additional encryption layers and access controls. Payment information is tokenized and processed through PCI-compliant third-party processors to minimize the system's exposure to financial data.

### Multilingual Support Architecture

The multilingual support system accommodates both English and French languages as required for Canadian applications. The frontend implements internationalization (i18n) using React-i18next, with language files containing all user-facing text in both languages.

Database content that requires translation, such as activity descriptions and system messages, is stored in JSON format with language keys. The API automatically returns content in the user's preferred language, falling back to English if French translations are unavailable.

Date and time formatting, currency display, and number formatting all respect Canadian localization standards, with proper handling of Quebec's specific requirements for French language display.

### API Design and Integration Points

The RESTful API follows OpenAPI 3.0 specifications, providing clear documentation and enabling automatic client code generation. All endpoints return consistent JSON responses with standardized error codes and messages in the user's preferred language.

The API is designed for extensibility, with versioning support to enable future enhancements without breaking existing integrations. Rate limiting and request throttling protect against abuse while ensuring fair resource allocation among users.

Integration points are provided for common third-party services including payment processors (Stripe, PayPal), email services (SendGrid, Mailgun), and SMS providers (Twilio). The modular design allows for easy addition of new integrations without affecting core functionality.

### Scalability and Performance Considerations

The architecture is designed to scale horizontally across multiple application servers with a shared database backend. Database queries are optimized with appropriate indexing strategies, and frequently accessed data is cached using Redis to reduce database load.

File storage for photos and documents utilizes cloud storage services (AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage) with CDN distribution for optimal performance across Canada's geographic expanse. The React frontend is optimized for performance with code splitting, lazy loading, and efficient state management.

Monitoring and alerting systems track application performance, error rates, and user experience metrics, enabling proactive identification and resolution of performance issues before they impact users.

This comprehensive architecture ensures that CareConnect Canada can reliably serve daycare providers and families across Canada while maintaining the highest standards of security, privacy, and performance.
